        <h1>About</h1></header><p>The acronym “afk”, short for “away from keyboard,” was used back in the 90s when boomers had to tell their AOL chatrooms they were leaving their computer for a bit, but would be back later. Similarly, {afkbookclub} isn’t about complete disconnection from the Internet. It’s about taking a step back to be mindful of how we spend our time both online and offline. We know about the good the Internet can achieve, but we also know too much of a good thing can be bad. Through book reading and discussion, we aim to take control of our relationship with technology and focus on overall self-development.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hosted on mataroa.blog to minimize all distractions and to keep the focus on reading, discussion, and participation of our members!</p>
