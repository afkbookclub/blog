##Welcome!
For many of us, our relationship with technology and social media can be fraught, and we sometimes have trouble disconnecting from our endless, personalized newsfeeds. It’s easy to get sucked into the vortex of daily updates, clickbait and cat videos. We’re here to encourage you to press pause on the eternal scrolling and take some time to breathe.

##How It Works!
`{afkbookclub}` uses books to facilitate conversations and inspire mindfulness about the time we spend online. Every month, we select a book that we think will spark discussion to read together. In our blog and newsletter, we have regular check-ins, thoughts, and prompts to encourage reflection and participation with the community as we read together.

##How Do I Participate?
Find a copy of our [book for the month](https://afkbookclub.mataroa.blog/booklist/) and [sign-up to receive our newsletter](https://afkbookclub.ck.page/b4ca002165). Contact us at [afkbookclub@gmail.com](afkbookclub@gmail.com) or comment on each of our blog posts to share your thoughts with the rest of the `{afkbookclub}` community. Once in a while, we'll highlight insightful ideas and showcase our members!

We also welcome all suggestions and feedback aimed to help develop and grow the community!
